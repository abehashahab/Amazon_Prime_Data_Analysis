The dataset consists of 9,331 total shows (combining both movies and TV shows) categorized into 24 unique rating categories and classified into 512 distinct genres. The analysis primarily focuses on identifying key insights related to content ratings, distribution between movies and TV shows, popular genres, and the geographical origin of shows.

Similarly, 372 movies are recommended for 16+, along with 48 TV shows in the same category and so on. This analysis provides valuable information about the age-appropriateness of the content available on Amazon Prime.
